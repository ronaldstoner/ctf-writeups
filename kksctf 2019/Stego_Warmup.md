## The Challenge
>  We get some file. Can you find secret?

We are provided the above file of Shaq gracefully obfuscating himself behind a tree. No other clues or hints are provided.

## The Solution

This was an extremely easy steganography challenge. The flag we are looking for is embedded inside the image data. We can extract the **EXIF** metadata from the image using **exiftool**, revealing the final flag.
