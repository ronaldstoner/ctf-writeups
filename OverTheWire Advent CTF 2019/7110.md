This write up is part of a bigger Capture The Flag competition. You can see other challenge write ups on the main post [here](https://medium.com/@forwardsecrecy/overthewire-advent-bonanza-2019-capture-the-flag-competition-66c50671c641).

### The Challenge

*Santa is stranded on the Christmas Islands and is desperately trying to reach his trusty companion via cellphone. We’ve bugged the device with a primitive keylogger and have been able to decode some of the SMS, but couldn’t make much sense of the last one. Can you give us a hand?*

### The Data

The challenge included an archive consisting of 4 comma delimited files, and 3 text files so that competitors could compare the data to the expected result. It was up to us to figure out message #4. Since I’ve been around awhile, I immediately recognized the name and nature of this type of challenge.

### The Background

In the pre-smartphone days, Nokia ruled the land of cell phones. They had limited features, could play Snake, and were built like tanks. Before we were all able to touch our screens to make things happen, we needed to use physical hardware buttons. Insane, right?!

Those same hardware buttons were used for sending SMS text messages between phones. Since you were only limited to the buttons on the keypad, each button needed to provide multiple functions.

In order to type the letter **A**, a user would hit the number **2** button one time. If you wanted to type a **B**, you’d hit the number **2** button two times. If you wanted a **C**, you’d hit it three times. This input style was referred to as **Multi-tap **— [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-tap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-tap).

Now imagine having to type a long story or grocery list to someone using that input style. Thankfully those days of painful texting are over, but this challenge reached out to the old school phreaker inside me.

In regards to the challenge name, the Nokia 7110 was a special edition phone with a sliding cover in honor of the movie “The Matrix”. The model number itself doesn’t have much to do with the challenge itself, but does point us to the text character set we should be using for the challenge.

### The Solution

The 4th message file contained data in the same format as the other files. When looking at the format, it shows a timestamp in the first column, with the digit pressed on the phone in the second. Numbers in the second column appearing in sequence indicate that specific button being pressed multiple times (in order for the letters for that number to cycle).

You may notice the numbers **100** through **103** and **11** in the above data. These represent the **hash**, **MENU_LEFT**, **MENU_RIGHT**, and other navigation buttons. At this point, the numbered key presses can be extracted and decoded for the flag. Due to the nature and knowledge of multi-tap, this can be achieved manually by hand, or using an automated script such as a python custom dictionary.

### The extracted key presses:
